               Photography, a very interesting concept. It maybe a very complicated process, but worth it as its a beautiful means of depicting emotions. For some it's a memory,
               for some it's a message, for some it's just sheer beauty, there is neither a right answer nor a wrong one here. It's a universal language. Our goal is to interact
               with all of you via this language, and depart on a journey to experience each and every story a picture depicts, be it a tiny drop of water or a majestic 
               mountain. To experience each picture, presented to you without any human interference in it, in its full natural glory, a rollercoaster ride we want all of us to 
               go on, together. Welcome to FILTER FREE FOTOGRAPHY - A humble beginning by a small group of people who want to share the power of pictures with you all. We 
               specialise in travel photography, showing you marvellous snaps of places all around the world. We understand the human psyche of wanting more, so we also provide
               videos of certain places to satisfy your desire of understanding those places, quenching your thirst for exploration, in the best we can digitally.We are 
               incredibly blessed to have a team of passionate photographers who work with us on any weekend. Please take a few minutes to know us and reach out to us through
