            <p>
                Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light,
                either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
                material such as photographic film.Image editing encompasses the processes of altering images,
                whether they are digital photographs, traditional photo-chemical photographs, or illustrations.
                Traditional analog image editing is known as photo retouching, using tools such as an airbrush to
                modify photographs or editing illustrations with any traditional art medium. Graphic software
                programs, which can be broadly grouped into vector graphics editors, raster graphics editors, and 3D

                place.
                
                To us photography is about people being real and then letting us paint a picture of that moment to
                remember it forever. This is the story that matters most: real people, real stories, real moments.
                
                We are incredibly blessed to have a team of photographers who work with us on any given weekend.
