The project was built using HTML 5, CSS 3, BOOTSTRAP 5 and JavaScript. A contact form that connects to our email address has also been added using an API called Formsubmit. This reduces the process of managing emails 30% more efficient compared to traditional methods. The music player was built from scratch and plays high quality music which have been composed by our very own teammate. We also have added a photo gallery that showcases a collection of original photos taken by another teammate of ours. Overall, it has been a great experience learning new things while developing this project as a team.
